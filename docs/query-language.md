# UAI Advanced Mode query language reference

Notes on the Asset Inventory **Advanced Mode** filter language, gathered by inspecting a live tenant. This is not official documentation and Infoblox may change any of it without notice.

New to queries? Start with [Queries for beginners](queries-for-beginners.md).

The filter bar is a [Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) editor whose language id is **`filterel`**. Queries are compiled client-side into [Cube.js](https://cube.dev/) queries against an `AssetDetails_ch_agg` cube.

## Shape of a query

```
<field> <operator> <value>
```

joined with `AND` / `OR`, grouped with parentheses:

```
asset.Type IN ["Laptop", "Workstation"] AND asset.OSType IN ["Windows"]
(asset.Confidence IN ["Low"]) OR (asset.Classifications IN ["Zombie"])
```

Field names may be written bare (`Type`) or namespaced (`asset.Type`). Both are accepted. Namespaced is preferred in this library: it is unambiguous, and it is the form the editor's autocomplete offers.

Operator keywords are conventionally uppercase. String values are double-quoted; list values go in `[ ... ]`.

## What differs between tenants, and what does not

Two tenants inspected on the same day presented noticeably different **autocomplete**, which is easy to mistake for a different query language. Tested against live data, it is not:

| | Tenant A | Tenant B |
|---|---|---|
| Root autocomplete | only `asset` | bare field names plus provider namespaces |
| `asset.` autocomplete | full field list | nothing |
| `Classifications` shown as | `Zombie`, `Noncompliant` | `zombie`, `oseol`, `oseos`, `oseossec`, `compliance`, `registration` |
| `MissingRecords` shown as | `DNS Forward Record`, `DNS Pointer Record`, `IPAM` | `missingdnsforwardrecord`, `missingdnsreverserecord` |
| Providers integrated | AWS, Azure, GCP, DHCP Logs, Infoblox Endpoint, NIOS | + ServiceNow, CrowdStrike, Intune, Jamf, Tenable, Meraki, Mist, Ordr, Aruba |
| Extra fields | — | `Category` (`Compute`, `Device`, `IoT`, `Network`, `Service`) |

**Queries are portable anyway.** Both differences are cosmetic, confirmed by comparing result counts on tenant B:

```
Type IN ["Laptop"]                              → 158     asset.Type IN ["Laptop"]                        → 158
Classifications IN ["zombie"]                   →  23     Classifications IN ["Zombie"]                   →  23
MissingRecords IN ["missingdnsforwardrecord"]   →  34     MissingRecords IN ["DNS Forward Record"]        →  34
```

So the `asset.` prefix is optional, and values are accepted in either the label or the code spelling, regardless of which one autocomplete happens to show you. This library uses the `asset.` prefix and label spellings throughout.

What genuinely does not carry across is **which providers and fields exist at all**. A `servicenow.*` query is meaningless where ServiceNow is not integrated, and `MissingRecords IN ["IPAM"]` only means something where IPAM data is present. That is what the `requiresProviders` field in the catalog is for.

> A caution learned the hard way while writing this page: the results table updates asynchronously, and reading the count too early gives you the *previous* query's number. Two of the figures above were wrong on first measurement for exactly that reason. When checking a query by hand, wait for the count to settle, and be suspicious of any result that exactly equals the previous one.

## Namespaces

| Namespace | Contents |
|---|---|
| `asset.` | The normalised, reconciled asset record. Always present. |
| `<provider>.` | Raw provider attributes, e.g. `servicenow.`, `crowdstrike_falcon.`, `intune.`, `jamf.`. Only present when that provider is integrated in the tenant. |

Provider namespaces expose the provider's own JSON structure verbatim, so paths are deep and provider-specific:

```
crowdstrike_falcon.crowdstrike_falcon_devices.device_policies.firewall.applied != "true"
```

**Autocomplete is tenant-scoped.** The editor only offers namespaces and values that exist in the tenant you are signed in to. A tenant with no Jamf integration will not suggest — and cannot usefully filter on — `jamf.*`.

How these paths are built, how to find the fields a tenant has, the rules for filtering on them, and a reference of every provider field seen in a demo tenant are all in **[Provider fields](provider-fields.md)**.

## Operators

| Kind | Operators |
|---|---|
| String / enum | `=`, `IS`, `ISNOT`, `IN`, `NOTIN`, `CONTAINS`, `DOESNOTCONTAIN` |
| Date | `ONDATE`, `AFTERDATE`, `BEFOREDATE`, `INDATERANGE`, `NOTINDATERANGE` |
| Logical | `AND`, `OR` |

`!=` is also accepted on raw provider attributes.

Dates are written `MM-DD-YYYY`:

```
asset.LastSeen AFTERDATE 08-01-2026
```

`EMPTY` is a sentinel value meaning the field has no value:

```
asset.SerialNumber IS "EMPTY"
```

## `asset.` fields

## Value vocabularies

Values below are those the product defines. Which ones actually appear depends on the tenant.

**`Confidence`** — `High`, `Medium`, `Low`, `EMPTY`

**`OverallStatus`** — `OK`, `ERROR`, `EMPTY`

**`LocationType`** — `Cloud`, `Onprem`, `EMPTY`

**`MissingRecords`** — `DNS Forward Record`, `DNS Pointer Record`, `IPAM`, `EMPTY`

**`OSType`** — `Windows`, `macOS`, `Linux`, `iOS`, `iPadOS`, `Android`, `VMware`, `Network OS`, `Embedded`, `Tizen`, `Axis`, `EMPTY`

**`Classifications`** — UAI's own insight taxonomy: `Zombie`, `Noncompliant`, `EMPTY`

**`SubClassifications`** — `Orphan`, `Public Access`, `Unencrypted`, `Resource Utilization Idle`, `Resource Utilization Low`, `EMPTY`

**`Type`** — the device taxonomy:

```
Cloud NAT              Internet Gateway              Smart Door Bell     Streaming Device
Cloud Security Group   Laptop                        Smart Plug          Surveillance Camera

```

## Behaviour worth knowing

**The default `Managed IS "True"` filter.** Asset Inventory ships with this filter applied. Clear it before pasting a query that is already scoped, or the two combine and you get fewer results than you expect.

**A rolling time window.** The inventory view scopes results to assets whose `updated_at` falls in a trailing window (7 days in the tenant inspected). Counts are "assets seen recently", not "all assets ever".

**Advanced queries are one-way.** Once a query uses advanced syntax, the UI cannot convert it back to Basic Mode. It says so in a tooltip on the Basic Mode link.

**In Basic Mode, `window.monaco` exists but owns nothing.** The library is already loaded and `window.monaco` is a live object, while `monaco.editor.getModels()` returns `[]` and `getEditors()` returns `0`. The editor is only instantiated when you switch to Advanced Mode — measured at 270 ms after the toggle click. So the presence of `window.monaco` tells you nothing about which mode you are in; the model list, or the mode toggle's label, is the only reliable signal.

The toggle is a plain button in the filter bar's footer row (`Ask IQ · Saved Filters · Advanced Mode · Clear · Save · Apply`), labelled with the mode it switches *to* — so `Advanced Mode` means you are currently in Basic.

**There is no client-side validation.** The editor registers no diagnostics: malformed queries produce no error markers and do not disable Apply. Mistakes surface only when the query reaches the server. Verify a query by running it and sanity-checking the count, not by trusting that it parsed.

## Saved Filters

The Save control next to the filter bar stores the current query as a named Saved Filter, listed under **Saved Filters** and manageable from the row menu there (Run Now, Mark as Favorite, Clone, Delete — Delete takes effect immediately, with no confirmation step).

**Names are capped at 50 characters, and the cap fails silently.** Measured on a live tenant: a 50-character name saves; a 51-character name does not, the popover closes as though it worked, and nothing appears in the list. There is no error message.

This is worth knowing beyond this project, because the obvious way to script bulk creation — click Save, type a name, click Save, assume it worked — will report complete success while quietly dropping every entry with a long name. Four of twenty-two went missing that way before the cause was found. Always read the list back.

## Asset Inventory has more than one route

The left nav reaches the same Asset Inventory page by two different routes, and they are not variants of one path:

| Menu path | Route | Filter bar? |
|---|---|---|
| **Assets → Inventory** | `#/workspace/assets/unified-details/managed-assets` | yes |
| **Network → Assets** | `#/workspace/assets?time_range=…&trend=…` | **no** |
| (clicking through from that dashboard) | `#/workspace/assets/details/managed-assets` | yes |

Both `*-details/managed-assets` routes render the same filter bar and the same `filterel` Monaco editor, so anything scripted against one works on the other. The default row scoping differs, though — the same tenant reported 1721 assets on `unified-details` and 2318 on `details` — so do not compare counts taken from different routes.

**Bare `#/workspace/assets` is not the inventory at all.** It is the Network Assets dashboard: charts and tiles, no filter bar, no Monaco editor — measured, it never appears, not at 12 seconds. You reach the inventory from there by clicking through a tile, which is why the inventory *seems* to live under that menu item.

So a route matcher needs to be narrow at both ends. `/workspace/assets/details/` alone misses the menu item most people use; the whole `/workspace/assets` prefix picks up the dashboard, where anything driving the filter bar has nothing to drive. Requiring a segment after `assets/` — `/\/workspace\/assets\/[^/?#]+\//` — covers both real routes and excludes the dashboard.

Better still, treat the route as a cheap pre-filter and confirm the filter bar is actually in the DOM before acting. It lands a few hundred milliseconds after the route settles, so that check has to be retried rather than made once.

## The portal routes with pushState, not hash assignment

Worth knowing before scripting anything that has to react to navigation: **`hashchange` does not fire when this app changes route.** Measured on a live route change from `.../details/...` to `.../unified-details/...`, the hash changed and `hashchange` fired zero times, because `history.pushState` never emits it — even when the hash it writes differs.

A `MutationObserver` on `document.body` is not a workaround either; with `childList` alone it only sees direct children, and route swaps happen deep in the tree.

What does work is wrapping `history.pushState` and `history.replaceState`, listening for `popstate`, and polling `location.href` as a backstop. Route changes also do **not** reload the page, so a userscript runs once and must handle every later navigation itself.

## Filter state in the URL

Asset Inventory keeps filter state in the URL hash:

```
#/workspace/assets/details/managed-assets?isAdvanced=true&advancedFilterValue=<encoded>&filter_items=<encoded>
```

Both encoded values are `JSON.stringify`'d and then compressed with [lz-string](https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string)'s `compressToEncodedURIComponent`. So:

```js
advancedFilterValue = LZString.compressToEncodedURIComponent(JSON.stringify(queryText))
```

This is what makes shareable query links possible — construct that URL and send it to anyone with tenant access.

Two limits, both confirmed by testing:

- The link **pre-loads** the query into the Advanced Mode filter bar. It does not run it; the recipient still presses Apply.
- The URL is only read on a **full page load**. Changing the hash in an already-open tab is ignored, because the SPA does not re-read filter state on hash change.

Applying an advanced query also back-fills `filter_items` with an equivalent basic-mode representation, which is where the underlying Cube dimension names are visible (`AssetDetails_ch_agg.providers`, `.taxonomy_types`, `.os_type`, and so on).
